This directory contains Email Marketing Templates and Transactional Emails

If you plan on using your own Email Marketing templates or want to store
the Email Marketing templates somewhere else the Email Marketing
directory can be moved or deleted without affecting the app.

The Email Marketing Templates are setup to be used with SendinBlue, but can be modified
to be used with other ESPs. Simply copy and paste the html code to the email template
editor on the website.

Email html is not the same as frontend html, which is why
all the styles are inline and html table elements are heavily used.

The emails are minimally styled to allow users to bring their own unique styles.
It is highly recommended to style the emails before going live. However the
emails are fully functional, meaning that the crucial pieces of info and functionality are
operational and setup. Only styling is required.

The emails not in the Email Marketing directory are all transactional
emails and should not be moved or deleted.
